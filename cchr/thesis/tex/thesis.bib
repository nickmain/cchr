	declareren in een gegeven host-taal. Vandaag wordt CHR bovendien
	gebruikt voor een ruime waaier van andere toepassingen en de implementatie
	van allerhande klassieke algoritmes. In deze thesis bespreken we
	de uitwerking vaneen gebruiksvriendelijk, efficient en flexibel CHR-systeem
	voor Java. Een implementatie die voldoet aan deze drie eisen bestond
	nog niet voor Java. Met features als een vertrouwde hoog-niveau syntax,
	coercion, generische handlers, willekeurige built-in constraints
	en indexering voor de constraint store, hopen we dat het K.U.Leuven
	JCHR Systeem hierin wel geslaagd is.},
